      <h1> ABOUT SKIN CANCER </h1>
    </header>

    <div class="section">
     <p class="paragraph"> Skin cancer is the most common malignancy and has been reported in many parts of the world.
      It is basically defined as an uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells. These are basal cell
      carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Early detection is a necessity for
      increasing the chances of treatment and ameliorating patients' outcomes. Conventional
      diagnosis essentially involves visual examination and physical examination that could be
      invasive and reliance on the physicians' skills.

        <p class="paragraph"> New areas for enhancing the accuracy of analytics are being opened up through advances in
          AI and deep learning. So far, CNNs have proved to be the most potent deep learning algorithms
          available in the analysis of images, and many medical imaging tasks, including such diverse
          ones as skin cancer diagnoses, have successfully adopted this technology. It allowed systems
          to precisely identify items from images through non-invasive effectiveness in diagnostic tools.

            This will very fundamentally alter pore and skin cancer diagnostics with earlier detection being
more accessible and reliable. Prevention measures and nutritional guidance add another
dimension to this device's application, giving the user a general managing tool for their skin
health. This is in line with larger moves toward individualized treatment and may positively
influence the reduction in incidence and impact of skin cancers.
